# collision-simulator
Basic one-dimensional particle collision simulator, with TkInter GUI.

This was created initially as part of my Extended Project Qualification (EPQ) during the second year of Sixth Form, and modified slightly for the University of York Computer Science Department's Raspberry Pi Challenge during Freshers' Week. I had a limited knowledge of how to program when I made this, and as such it is not very impressive!
